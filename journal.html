        Up until now, I have created a person card and am working on a code sketch. Even though the person card was just a simple transition from a picture of a mountain to a picture of a cosy cabin, I still struggled with it a little because I made a small error that took me a long time to find and correct. As for the code sketch, I am making a website that showcases different foods and the ingredients that it takes to make them. I would say that the project is going well and I am on a steady track to complete it soon. Whilst working on these projects, I have learned some of the basics of javascript, html, and css. Sometimes just overlooking simple errors has been frustrating, but when I figure out what I was doing incorrectly and fix my mistake, it feels very satisfying. Overall, I am feeling pretty good about computer science and feel like labs have been fun and informative too. I have come to labs both and alone and with friends like Carter and Rex. Talking about our ideas and asking for help has been immensely helpful. Moving forward, I am excited to learn. One way that I look forward to broadening my knowledge of computer science is through my own projects. I find that for this subject, learning as I go and looking into what I need to know to work on an idea has been the best way for me to become more proficient at coding. However, I also like the videos that were assigned to us. Reading the article, however, got just a little monotonous, but it was still ok.

        This week, I worked on my website and had a productive lab. I think that my rough draft is a good starting point and I feel as though I have a clear idea of what I will do going forward. For instance, I want to link up my first codesketch in the projects section of my website.

        This week I put my website up on the internet! It was not too hard and the outcome was certainly worth the work.

        This week, I created a new codesketch and added to an old one. A few problems came up that I am planning on addressing in the future, but it was just nice to get code down and to see cool results.

        This week I finished two projects that I have been working on for a few weeks and Iâ€™m really happy about how they turned out. I also added all my journal entries to my website and uploaded everything to the internet.

       This week I worked on a mock up for two possible codesketches. One would track my weekly screen time and the other would track how many bowls of cereal I eat in a week.

      This week I caught up on some things and reflected on my past work. I made sure that my journals were up to date and added a little bit to my websites.
